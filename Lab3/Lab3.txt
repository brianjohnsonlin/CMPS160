Lab 3: Transformations
The goal of this lab is to get you familiar with transformations such as rotate, translate, and scale, as well as using matrices to manipulate points in 3D space.

Starter Code
To get the starter code running on your machine follow these steps (we assume you have the setup outlined in the Starter Code section of Lab 1):
1. Create a subdirectory inside Labs called Lab3 that will contain the code for this lab.
2. On the book's source site download gasket4.js and gasket4.html (found here) into the Lab3 folder. This file contains a 3D gasket.
3. Try running gasket4.html in a WebGL supported browser.

Base Goals (Grade: C)
To complete this lab requires the following:
1. Draw your gasket in 3D instead of 2D - see the Starter Code section above. Make sure you understand how the 3D gasket is drawn before continuing.
2. Add a checkerboard ground plane below your gasket.
3. Use mouse motion, sliders, or any other UI elements to show you can do all of the following:
 - Rotate the gasket about the X, Y, and Z axes.
 - Translate the gasket along the X, Y, and Z axes.

Stretch Goals (Grade: A or B)
Complete one of these goals for a B and two for an A:
1. The location of points is computed as MV * p. We can do this computation on the CPU or GPU. The base assignment computes the matrix MV on the CPU and the multiplication MV*p on the GPU. This matches the historical way graphics has been done for years. Instead try computing MV*p on the CPU and passing the transformed points to the GPU. Compare the speed and see if it matters. Try passing just a rotation angle to the GPU and computing MV there. Measure the speed, does it make any difference?
2. Modify the checkerboard ground plane to have height variation. That is, make it look like a terrain map with mountains and valleys.
3. Any idea from Ch. 3 that you haven't done already.
4. Ideas?
