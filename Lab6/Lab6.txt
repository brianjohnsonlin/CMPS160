Lab 6: Texture
The goal of this lab is to get you famiular with using textures in Computer Graphics.

Starter Code
The starter code for this lab will be the code from your completed Lab 5:
1. Create a subdirectory inside Labs called Lab6 that will contain the code for this lab.
2. Copy the files from your Lab5 folder into Lab6.
3. Start implementing.

Base Goals (Grade: C)
To complete this lab requires the following:
1. Add texture to both the ground plane and the sphere in your scene.
2. Provide a UI to toggle between all of these four options:
 - No texture
 - Checkerboard texture. This can be created via code.
 - First texture of your choice 
 - Second texture of your choice
 --> Any texture image is fine as long as at least one of them is recognizable (i.e. not just swirly patterns).
 --> Load each texture image from a file.
3. Add UI to toggle lighting on/off. This should make visible difference in the image.
4. Show that you can move the camera without the textures moving incorrectly.
5. Show that you can move the sphere without the textures moving incorrectly.

Stretch Goals (Grade: A or B)
1. Implement mipmapping and interpolation. Construct an example to show their effect.
2. Add a mirror object and reflection / environment mapping.
3. Add two transparent spheres or other objects and use alpha blending to get correct images.
4. Add interaction with multiple objects using picking. Perhaps multiple spheres or small regions of the ground plane, or whatever makes sense in your environment.
5. Any of the prior extras you have not completed.
